# Hobbits
Dr. Goldstein's PA 5: hobbits
***
## Input:
A list of numbers that represent the value of each floating pad.
## Process:
Let h be the maximal number of hobbits that can be saved such that <b>0 < h <= maximal pads</b>.
## Output:
Each line of output represents the path a hobbit can cross. Thus, the number of lines
determine the maximum number of hobbit(s) that can be saved.
